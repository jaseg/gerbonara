; This is a sample file modeled after a composite drill file generated by what seems to be an older altium version.
; It contains plating type comments not at the tool defintions but at the tool selections.
; The original file this was modeled after can be found at: https://github.com/snz222/project_1/blob/f3cd3d36c98deef895af1bd868d9a887cab03357/pcb/gerber/pselectro/COMPOSIT_1.DRL
; This test file was created instead since this repo does not state any license.
