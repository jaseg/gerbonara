FLASH PAD GEOMETRY:

	NEGATIVE LAYER FLASH PADS;

		1. Thermal Relief flash Pads. Are dimensioned in mils,
			without leading zeros. They are encoded as follows:

			t 90 70 15x45 sp4
			| |  |    |    |_ number of spokes
			| |  |    |
			| |  |    |_spoke width and angle
			| |  |
			| |  |_inside diameter
			| |
			| |_outside diameter
			|
			|_thermal relief

		2. tdirect is used to make full contact with the plane.
			A 5 mil circle or blank flash may be substituted.

		3. Anti-pad with copper pad retained. Used on negative layers
			where pad must be used as land contact for blind or buried vias

			s ap 20 12
			| |  |  |_ inside pad dimention
			| |  |
			| |  |_ outside anti-pad dimention
			| |
			| |_ anti-pad designator
			|
			|_ s = square i.d. o.d. dimentions
			   c = circular i.d. o.d. dimentions

	POSITIVE LAYER FLASH PADS;

		1. cir40 (cir#) is used to indicate a spotting pad for non-plated holes.
			A 40 (or #) mil circle or blank flash may be substituted.

		2. Doughnut pads are used where land is required around non-plated holes
			with relief of the land for the non-plated drill. They are encoded as follows:

			dp 250 x 190
			|  |     |_ inside diameter
			|  |
			|  |_ outside diameter
			|
			|_ doughnut pad
